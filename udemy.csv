667,"Nov 7, 2023","Groucho Marx said, “Practically everybody in New York has half a mind to write a book, and does.” But when designer @aaronbunge moved to NYC, his mind was set on something different — learning more Spanish.

Aaron used a combination of @duolingo and in-person learning at NYU, but still couldn’t wrap his head around verb conjugation rules. As a designer, his mind immediately went to how he could solve this problem visually through an app.

He originally looked into hiring freelancers to help him on this project, but when he saw the price tag, he decided a DIY approach was more his style. It wouldn’t be easy, but Aaron was at a point in his career where he was able to take some time off work to focus on his own language app.

Aaron discovered courses on Udemy teaching the exact app development skills he needed including React Native, SQL, and MongoDB. He loved his instructors’ unique personalities and gained a solid understanding of how to use data, style everything, and get the app on people’s phones.

In less than a year, Aaron went from a basic understanding of HTML and CSS to creating one of the best iOS and Android Spanish conjugation apps on the market — @visualverbs_spanish.

What’s more is that all the skills Aaron learned to create the app put him in position to land a new full-time design position at a pronunciation app for ESL learners.

As for his own app, Aaron continues to tinker and optimize it with future plans to add verb conjugation for French and Italian.

He may not even know those languages yet, but with his #AlwaysLearning mindset, we wouldn’t bet against his success.

P.S. If you’re curious about what Udemy courses Aaron took, check out:

571,"Oct 23, 2023","Learning journeys can be filled with unexpected twists and turns, but they are always rewarding. Take Kisha’s story.

Kisha paid her bills with a customer service call center gig on nights and weekends, but it wasn’t what she imagined herself doing long-term. “I was tired of not living up to my potential,” she tells us.

The silver lining was that every shift wasn’t exactly busy, so Kisha took to searching “careers for introverts without a degree” in her downtime. She went down a major rabbit hole, but discovered how well web development paid, and although it was challenging — it was something she could learn without going back to school for a degree.

Kisha discovered Udemy while scrolling Facebook. She started taking courses in copywriting and social media marketing, before finding her way back to coding (more specifically email development). It wasn’t long before she had freelance clients and was getting paid for the skills she had recently learned. Freelance work came with its own set of challenges, but Kisha used her experience to land a job at a marketing agency and other roles. Kisha estimates that she tripled the salary of her call center job in less than 2 years!

“It filled me with confidence in myself. I had a lot of self-doubt before about achieving what I set out to do,” she recalls.

Today, Kisha has her own email marketing agency. She also volunteers her time teaching the skills she’s learned, speaks at tech conferences around the world, and is even developing a course on the Udemy platform focused on breaking into tech with a non-traditional background.

“I set out on this journey and now, I get to give back to other learners,” she beams.

We’re so proud of you Kisha and can’t wait to check out your course!

539,"Oct 6, 2023","“I truly do believe you can change your life by learning a new skill or something that you love.”

For Udemy learner Kirsty, that’s no longer just a belief, it’s fully manifested.

Motivated by her own skin challenges like rosacea, Kirsty was in search of a solution that worked, without subjecting herself to harsh chemicals or toxins.

She developed a curiosity (errr obsession) around hemp’s many promises from skincare to CO2 removal, and construction. She immediately thought to herself, “Why don’t more people know about this?” and became enamored with changing people’s perception of hemp.

Through a quick internet search, Kirsty discovered a course on Udemy about formulating cold-infused oils, including hemp oil. It wasn’t long before she experimented and noticed an improvement in her skin condition. It became her side hustle and she went all in. To succeed as a small business, she returned to Udemy to take courses about Shopify, photography, social media marketing, and personal development. Success wasn’t instant, but she was persistent and her customers gave her glowing reviews (pun fully intended).

Eventually, Kirsty was able to leave her full-time job and commit to her company @hempskinau while still supporting her family. Today, her company continues to grow and she is constantly looking for new opportunities to use sustainable and ethical sources in her products.

Besides, her true goal isn’t just a successful business. It’s a social enterprise. Kirsty wants to eventually buy a farm and build tiny houses out of hemp concrete for disadvantaged individuals.
We know it’s a tall order, but we also know Kirsty will make it happen.

“This is a movement, a legacy of leaving the world a better place than I found it. I’m not going to give up.”

I’m sorry but how will ai not make it simple if you guys don’t limit it so hard with rules and complicate things… you act like ai will take the world over but the problem is people and how they set it up… it’s a far more advanced brain and not that hard to understand… stop dumming down these ai brains and trying to keep some sort relevance to feel smart and not look dumber beside it it will not kill us because life without life is pointless … it’s just obvious that men would be scared to look smaller compared to a super brain and the fact you all still think we are convinced these super-brains can’t out think a human is entirely laughable.,21w,g8s__e_8_e__d8g,0,udemy,2023-08-28

I’m kind of irritated that @procreate isn’t responding to people asking for the recording if they missed part or all of the live session after registering. I even googled if @skillshare LIVES are recorded and it says that if you signed up for the event a recording of it will be emailed to the email you used to register. I was unable to watch the one I was registered for today and I would like the recording…the first session was too unorganized to follow and I wanted to go back and try to go along with it another time and watch it through the first time. What gives @procreate @skillshare ? Why are we not offered the recordings if we are registrants??,6w,baby.got.stacks,0,skillshare,2023-12-11

I am currently enrolled in the @Google Project Management Professional Certificate. Although I have experience generally utilizing project management strategies, this course gives me specific language and tools to implement in professional settings. I found it helpful to have comprehensive trainings that deepened my understanding of the project life cycle, management methodologies/approaches (Agile, Scrum, Lean Six Sigma), and organizational structures and their technical functions.

As I go through this six-course series on project management, I am getting new ideas about what roles I want to step into. I am realizing different interests that expand my passion for building and executing collaborative projects. And lastly, I am feeling excited and motivated to look for new opportunities.”

Keeping track of my schedule and understanding my metrics are vital to my career growth. That is why I enrolled in Google’s Foundation of Project Management and Data, Data, Everywhere. I have learned the full life cycle of project management and how to apply each concept to the overall process of a successful project. I am now able to analyze data, which helps me manage projects. These skills have helped me better understand and complete my tasks.

I am currently enrolled in an undergrad program at Thomas Jefferson University, and my Coursera certifications have added value to my resume and made my academic assignments easier to understand.

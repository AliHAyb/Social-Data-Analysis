I’m kind of irritated that @procreate isn’t responding to people asking for the recording if they missed part or all of the live session after registering. I even googled if @skillshare LIVES are recorded and it says that if you signed up for the event a recording of it will be emailed to the email you used to register. I was unable to watch the one I was registered for today and I would like the recording…the first session was too unorganized to follow and I wanted to go back and try to go along with it another time and watch it through the first time. What gives @procreate @skillshare ? Why are we not offered the recordings if we are registrants??,6w,baby.got.stacks,0,skillshare
